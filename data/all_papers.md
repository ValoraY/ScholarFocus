| 2025 | Intern-s1: A scientific multimodal foundation model | In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged, achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL training. On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals.

| 2025 | Scientists' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning | Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10521) |
| 2025 | Dd-ranking: Rethinking the evaluation of dataset distillation | In recent years, dataset distillation has provided a reliable solution for data compression, where models trained on the resulting smaller synthetic datasets achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original datasets. To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13300) |
| 2025 | Verigui: Verifiable long-chain gui dataset | Recent studies have delved into constructing autonomous agents capable of performing complex Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based computer tasks, with the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. Despite encouraging results, existing efforts mainly focus on short-term interactions and rely on outcome-only verification, thereby limiting their scalability in real-world GUI applications that demand long-horizon task decomposition and execution. In this work, we introduce VeriGUI, a novel verifiable long-chain GUI dataset designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of generalist GUI agents operating in realistic computer environments. Our dataset emphasizes two critical dimensions: (1) long-chain complexity, with tasks decomposed into a sequence of interdependent subtasks spanning hundreds of steps, explicitly designed to allow any subtask to serve as a valid starting point; and (2) subtask-level verifiability, which enables diverse exploration strategies within each subtask, while ensuring that each subtask-level goal remains verifiable and consistent. The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories across both desktop and web, annotated by human experts. Extensive experiments on VeriGUI using various agents with different foundation models reveal significant performance gaps in handling long-horizon tasks, highlighting the need for more robust planning and decision-making capabilities in GUI agents. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04026) |
| 2025 | MSEarth: A Benchmark for Multimodal Scientific Comprehension of Earth Science | The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has unlocked new opportunities to tackle complex scientific challenges. Despite this progress, their application in addressing earth science problems, especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, featuring over 289K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges. By bridging the gap in graduate-level benchmarks, MSEarth provides a scalable and high-fidelity resource to enhance the development and evaluation of MLLMs in scientific reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to foster further research and innovation in this field. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20740) |
| 2025 | EarthSE: A Benchmark Evaluating Earth Scientific Exploration Capability for Large Language Models | Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) drive interest in scientific applications, necessitating specialized benchmarks such as Earth science. Existing benchmarks either present a general science focus devoid of Earth science specificity or cover isolated subdomains, lacking holistic evaluation. Furthermore, current benchmarks typically neglect the assessment of LLMs' capabilities in open-ended scientific exploration. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and professional benchmark for the Earth sciences, designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration within this domain, spanning from fundamental to advanced levels. Leveraging a corpus of 100,000 research papers, we first construct two Question Answering (QA) datasets: Earth-Iron, which offers extensive question coverage for broad assessment, and Earth-Silver, which features a higher level of difficulty to evaluate professional depth. These datasets encompass five Earth spheres, 114 disciplines, and 11 task categories, assessing foundational knowledge crucial for scientific exploration. Most notably, we introduce Earth-Gold with new metrics, a dataset comprising open-ended multi-turn dialogues specifically designed to evaluate the advanced capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration, including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept proposal. Extensive experiments reveal limitations in 11 leading LLMs across different domains and tasks, highlighting considerable room for improvement in their scientific exploration capabilities. The benchmark is available on https://huggingface.co/ai-earth . | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17139) |
| 2025 | Drag-and-Drop LLMs: Zero-Shot Prompt-to-Weights | Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs), yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to \textbf{12,000} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii) robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing LLMs. Our project is available at \href{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16406) |
| 2025 | REPA Works Until It Doesn't: Early-Stopped, Holistic Alignment Supercharges Diffusion Training | Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art image quality, yet their training remains notoriously slow. A recent remedy -- representation alignment (REPA) that matches DiT hidden features to those of a non-generative teacher (e.g. DINO) -- dramatically accelerates the early epochs but plateaus or even degrades performance later. We trace this failure to a capacity mismatch: once the generative student begins modelling the joint data distribution, the teacher's lower-dimensional embeddings and attention patterns become a straitjacket rather than a guide. We then introduce HASTE (Holistic Alignment with Stage-wise Termination for Efficient training), a two-phase schedule that keeps the help and drops the hindrance. Phase I applies a holistic alignment loss that simultaneously distills attention maps (relational priors) and feature projections (semantic anchors) from the teacher into mid-level layers of the DiT, yielding rapid convergence. Phase II then performs one-shot termination that deactivates the alignment loss, once a simple trigger such as a fixed iteration is hit, freeing the DiT to focus on denoising and exploit its generative capacity. HASTE speeds up training of diverse DiTs without architecture changes. On ImageNet 256X256, it reaches the vanilla SiT-XL/2 baseline FID in 50 epochs and matches REPA's best FID in 500 epochs, amounting to a 28X reduction in optimization steps. HASTE also improves text-to-image DiTs on MS-COCO, demonstrating to be a simple yet principled recipe for efficient diffusion training across various tasks.

| 2025 | E-3SFC: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning With Double-Way Features Synthesizing | The exponential growth in model sizes has significantly increased the communication burden in federated learning (FL). Existing methods to alleviate this burden by transmitting compressed gradients often face high compression errors, which slow down the model’s convergence. To simultaneously achieve high compression effectiveness and lower compression errors, we study the gradient compression problem from a novel perspective. Specifically, we propose a systematical algorithm termed extended single-step synthetic features compressing (E-3SFC), which consists of three subcomponents, i.e., the single-step synthetic features compressor (3SFC), a double-way compression (DWC) algorithm, and a communication budget scheduler (BS). First, we regard the process of gradient computation of a model as decompressing gradients from corresponding inputs, while the inverse process is considered as … | [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10905051/) |
| 2025 | HyperNAS: Enhancing Architecture Representation for NAS Predictor via Hypernetwork | Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0 fewer samples. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18151) |
| 2025 | Make optimization once and for all with fine-grained guidance | Learning to Optimize (L2O) enhances optimization efficiency with integrated neural networks. L2O paradigms achieve great outcomes, e.g., refitting optimizer, generating unseen solutions iteratively or directly. However, conventional L2O methods require intricate design and rely on specific optimization processes, limiting scalability and generalization. Our analyses explore general framework for learning optimization, called Diff-L2O, focusing on augmenting sampled solutions from a wider view rather than local updates in real optimization process only. Meanwhile, we give the related generalization bound, showing that the sample diversity of Diff-L2O brings better performance. This bound can be simply applied to other fields, discussing diversity, mean-variance, and different tasks. Diff-L2O's strong compatibility is empirically verified with only minute-level training, comparing with other hour-levels. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11462) |
| 2025 | Ferret: An Efficient Online Continual Learning Framework under Varying Memory Constraints | In the realm of high-frequency data streams, achieving real-time learning within varying memory constraints is paramount. This paper presents Ferret, a comprehensive framework designed to enhance online accuracy of Online Continual Learning (OCL) algorithms while dynamically adapting to varying memory budgets. Ferret employs a fine-grained pipeline parallelism strategy combined with an iterative gradient compensation algorithm, ensuring seamless handling of high-frequency data with minimal latency, and effectively counteracting the challenge of stale gradients in parallel training. To adapt to varying memory budgets, its automated model partitioning and pipeline planning optimizes performance regardless of memory limitations. Extensive experiments across 20 benchmarks and 5 integrated OCL algorithms show Ferret's remarkable efficiency, achieving up to 3.7 x lower memory overhead to reach the same online accuracy compared to competing methods. Furthermore, Ferret consistently outperforms these methods across diverse memory budgets, underscoring its superior adaptability. These findings position Ferret as a premier solution for efficient and adaptive OCL framework in real-time environments. | [Link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Zhou_Ferret_An_Efficient_Online_Continual_Learning_Framework_under_Varying_Memory_CVPR_2025_paper.html) |
| 2025 | ResearchGPT: Benchmarking and Training LLMs for End-to-End Computer Science Research Workflows | As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even 7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as reliable collaborators in CS research. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20279) |
| 2025 | Data Efficient Any Transformer-to-Mamba Distillation via Attention Bridge | State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work, we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability. We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods. Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer expertise for building a stronger SSM community. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19266) |
| 2025 | FlowSearch: Advancing deep research with dynamic structured knowledge flow | Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA, demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and its potential to advance scientific discovery.

| 2025 | SciReasoner: Laying the Scientific Reasoning Ground Across Disciplines | We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct tuning datasets and the evaluation code are open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/SciReason and https://github.com/open-sciencelab/SciReason. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21320) |
| 2025 | Pruning-Robust Mamba with Asymmetric Multi-Scale Scanning Paths | Mamba has proven efficient for long-sequence modeling in vision tasks. However, when token reduction techniques are applied to improve efficiency, Mamba-based models exhibit drastic performance degradation compared to Vision Transformers (ViTs).  This decline is potentially attributed to Mamba's chain-like scanning mechanism, which we hypothesize not only induces cascading losses in token connectivity but also limits the diversity of spatial receptive fields. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Multi-scale Vision Mamba (AMVim), a novel architecture designed to enhance pruning robustness. AMVim employs a dual-path structure, integrating a window-aware scanning mechanism into one path while retaining sequential scanning in the other. This asymmetry design promotes token connection diversity and enables multi-scale information flow, reinforcing spatial awareness. Empirical results demonstrate that AMVim achieves state-of-the-art pruning robustness. During token reduction, AMVim-T achieves a substantial 34\% improvement in training-free accuracy with identical model sizes and FLOPs. Meanwhile, AMVim-S exhibits only a 1.5\% accuracy drop, performing comparably to ViT. Notably, AMVim also delivers superior performance during pruning-free settings, further validating its architectural advantages. | [Link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BZSTC2RMEd) |
| 2025 | Deploying Models to Non-participating Clients in Federated Learning without Fine-tuning: A Hypernetwork-based Approach | Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative learning, yet data heterogeneity remains a critical challenge. While existing methods achieve progress in addressing data heterogeneity for participating clients, they fail to generalize to non-participating clients with in-domain distribution shifts and resource constraints. To mitigate this issue, we present HyperFedZero, a novel method that dynamically generates specialized models via a hypernetwork conditioned on distribution-aware embeddings. Our approach explicitly incorporates distribution-aware inductive biases into the model's forward pass, extracting robust distribution embeddings using a NoisyEmbed-enhanced extractor with a Balancing Penalty, effectively preventing feature collapse. The hypernetwork then leverages these embeddings to generate specialized models chunk-by-chunk for non-participating clients, ensuring adaptability to their unique data distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate HyperFedZero's remarkable performance, surpassing competing methods consistently with minimal computational, storage, and communication overhead. Moreover, ablation studies and visualizations further validate the necessity of each component, confirming meaningful adaptations and validating the effectiveness of HyperFedZero. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12673) |
| 2025 | GPS: Distilling Compact Memories via Grid-based Patch Sampling for Efficient Online Class-Incremental Learning | Online class-incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously adapt to new classes with limited access to past data, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based methods address this by maintaining a small memory buffer of previous samples, achieving competitive performance. For effective replay under constrained storage, recent approaches leverage distilled data to enhance the informativeness of memory. However, such approaches often involve significant computational overhead due to the use of bi-level optimization. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce Grid-based Patch Sampling (GPS), a lightweight and effective strategy for distilling informative memory samples without relying on a trainable model. GPS generates informative samples by sampling a subset of pixels from the original image, yielding compact low-resolution representations that preserve both semantic content and structural information. During replay, these representations are reassembled to support training and evaluation. Experiments on extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GRS can be seamlessly integrated into existing replay frameworks, leading to 3%-4% improvements in average end accuracy under memory-constrained settings, with limited computational overhead. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10409) |
| 2025 | EA-ViT: Efficient Adaptation for Elastic Vision Transformer | Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks. However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads, embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at https://github. com/zcxcf/EA-ViT. | [Link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2025/html/Zhu_EA-Vit_Efficient_Adaptation_for_Elastic_Vision_Transformer_ICCV_2025_paper.html) |
| 2024 | Federated CINN clustering for accurate clustered federated learning | Federated Learning (FL) presents an innovative approach to privacy-preserving distributed machine learning and enables efficient crowd intelligence on a large scale. However, a significant challenge arises when coordinating FL with crowd intelligence which diverse client groups possess disparate objectives due to data heterogeneity or distinct tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the Federated cINN Clustering Algorithm (FCCA) to robustly cluster clients into different groups, avoiding mutual interference between clients with data heterogeneity, and thereby enhancing the performance of the global model. Specifically, FCCA utilizes a global encoder to transform each client’s private data into multivariate Gaussian distributions. It then employs a generative model to learn encoded latent features through maximum likelihood estimation, which eases optimization and avoids mode collapse. Finally, the central … | [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10447282/) |
| 2024 | DeFTA: A plug-and-play peer-to-peer decentralized federated learning framework | Federated learning (FL) is a pivotal catalyst for enabling large-scale privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML). By eliminating the need for local raw dataset sharing, FL substantially reduces privacy concerns and alleviates the isolated data problem. However, in reality, the success of FL is predominantly attributed to a centralized framework called FedAvg [1], in which workers are responsible for model training, and servers are in control of model aggregation. Nevertheless, FedAvg's centralized worker-server architecture has raised new concerns, including low scalability of the cluster, risk of data leakage, and central server failure or even defection. To overcome these challenges, we propose Decentralized Federated Trusted Averaging (DeFTA), a decentralized FL framework that serves as a plug-and-play replacement for FedAvg, bringing instant improvements to security, scalability, and fault-tolerance … | [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002002552400495X) |
| 2024 | Faster Vision Mamba is Rebuilt in Minutes via Merged Token Re-training | Vision Mamba has shown close to state of the art performance on computer vision tasks, drawing much interest in increasing it's efficiency. A promising approach is token reduction (that has been successfully implemented in ViTs). Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and degraded performance. An alternative, of merging tokens preserves more information than pruning, also suffers for large compression ratios. Our key insight is that a quick round of retraining after token merging yeilds robust results across various compression ratios. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drops 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12496) |
| 2024 | Learning Locally, Revising Globally: Global Reviser for Federated Learning with Noisy Labels | The success of most federated learning (FL) methods heavily depends on label quality, which is often inaccessible in real-world scenarios, such as medicine, leading to the federated label-noise (F-LN) problem. In this study, we observe that the global model of FL memorizes the noisy labels slowly. Based on the observations, we propose a novel approach dubbed Global Reviser for Federated Learning with Noisy Labels (FedGR) to enhance the label-noise robustness of FL. In brief, FedGR employs three novel modules to achieve noisy label sniffing and refining, local knowledge revising, and local model regularization. Specifically, the global model is adopted to infer local data proxies for global sample selection and refine incorrect labels. To maximize the utilization of local knowledge, we leverage the global model to revise the local exponential moving average (EMA) model of each client and distill it into the clients' models. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local representation regularization to mitigate the overfitting of noisy labels. Extensive experiments on three F-LNL benchmarks against seven baseline methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedGR. | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00452) |
